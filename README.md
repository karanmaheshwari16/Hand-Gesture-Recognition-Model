# Hand Gesture Recognition Model

This project is a hand gesture recognition model built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is designed to recognize and classify different hand gestures.

Features
- Gesture Recognition: The model accurately detects and classifies a wide range of hand gestures.
- CNN Architecture: Built on CNNs for efficient and high-performance image classification.
- User-Friendly Interface: The system can easily integrate into applications requiring gesture-based inputs.

# How It Works
The model takes images of hand gestures as input, processes them using convolutional layers, and outputs the corresponding gesture class.
